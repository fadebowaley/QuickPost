# Usage

## Fetching Data

To fetch blog post data from the JSON server, use the following code:

```javascript
// Import dependencies
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

// Define a function to fetch data
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://your-json-server-url/posts");
    const data = await response.json();
    // Set the data in your component state
    setData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
};

// Use the fetchData function in a useEffect hook
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

# CRUD Operations

Implementing CRUD operations involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. You can use callbacks and React hooks to manage these operations. Here's a basic example for creating a new blog post:

```javascript
// Import dependencies
import { useState } from "react";

// Define a function to create a new blog post
const createPost = (newPostData) => {
  // Make a POST request to the JSON server to create the new post
  fetch("https://your-json-server-url/posts", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(newPostData),
  })
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      // Handle the response data as needed
      console.log("New blog post created:", data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error creating blog post:", error);
    });
};

// Use the createPost function when creating a new post
const handleCreatePost = () => {
  const newPostData = {
    title: "New Blog Post",
    content: "This is the content of the new blog post.",
    author: "John Doe",
  };

  createPost(newPostData);
};
```

This is a basic example of creating a new blog post. Similar functions can be created for reading, updating, and deleting posts.
